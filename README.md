# Simple-System-Simulator-
The system I simulate is to get printing requests from users and distribute those requests to the printers. Each printer can do their work alone, and when it's done with it's printing task, it will receive the next request from the users. In this way, the system can maximize the printing resources and process the users' printing requests efficiently.
